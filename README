##################  libORF  - library On Random Fields ####################

version 1.0 beta
- Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Softmax Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine, Non-Linear Support Vector Machine (with RBF kernel),
Feed-forward Neural Network, Embedding Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, Sparse Autoencoders, Denoising Autoencoders, 
Contractive Autoencoders, Stacked Sparse Autoencoders, Self-Taught Learner and Restricted Boltzmann Machines are tested with this version.
- Rest of the methods are not tested hence not supplied and the progress is as follows: 	
	+ Deep Belief Nets with Restricted Boltzmann Machines (not tested)
	+ Bayes Nets (tested - refactoring)
	+ Hidden Markov Models (tested - refactoring)
	+ Conditional Random Fields (work in progress)

PREREQUISITES
- What you need is an optimizer function where minfunc (by Mark Schmidt) is included along with the toolbox
http://www.di.ens.fr/~mschmidt/Software/minFunc.html
- For running examples you need sample datasets which can be downloaded from the link below ~80mb. If the link is
broken feel free to contact me. After downloading data archive, extract all the files into libORF/data/ folder.

USAGE:
libORF is written using object oriented matlab, just instantiate and call appropriate methods.
A full documentation is not supplied with this beta version, but the code is well commented.
Please refer to example scripts for sample usage by simply calling run_<method>.m
